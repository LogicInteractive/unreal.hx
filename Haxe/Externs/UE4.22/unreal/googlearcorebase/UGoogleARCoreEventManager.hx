    A dynamic delegate can be assigned through blueprint. Will be called before ARSession started and returns
    an array of supported ARCore camera config.
    
    The array will always return 3 camera configs. The GPU texture resolutions
    are the same in all three configs. Currently, most devices provide GPU
    texture resolution of 1920 x 1080, but devices might provide higher or lower
    resolution textures, depending on device capabilities. The CPU image
    resolutions returned are VGA, 720p, and a resolution matching the GPU
    texture.
    
    Bind this delegate if you want to choose a specific camera config in your app. Call
    UGoogleARCoreSessionFunctionLibrary::ConfigARCoreCamera after the delegate is triggered.

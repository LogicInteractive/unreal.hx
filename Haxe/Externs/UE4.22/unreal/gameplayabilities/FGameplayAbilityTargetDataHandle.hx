/**
  Handle for Targeting Data. This servers two main purposes:
          -Avoid us having to copy around the full targeting data structure in Blueprints
          -Allows us to leverage polymorphism in the target data structure
          -Allows us to implement NetSerialize and replicate by value between clients/server
  
          -Avoid using UObjects could be used to give us polymorphism and by reference passing in blueprints.
          -However we would still be screwed when it came to replication
  
          -Replication by value
          -Pass by reference in blueprints
          -Polymophism in TargetData structure

/**
  Defines the set of all GameplayAttributes for your game
  Games should subclass this and add FGameplayAttributeData properties to represent attributes like health, damage, etc
  AttributeSets are added to the actors as subobjects, and then registered with the AbilitySystemComponent
  It often desired to have several sets per project that inherit from each other
  You could make a base health set, then have a player set that inherits from it and adds more attributes

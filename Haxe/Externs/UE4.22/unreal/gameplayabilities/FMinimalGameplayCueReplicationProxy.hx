/**
  An alternative way to replicating gameplay cues. This does not use fast TArray serialization and does not serialize gameplaycue parameters. The parameters are created on the receiving side with default information.
  This will be more efficient with server cpu but will take more bandwidth when the array changes.
  
  To use, put this on your replication proxy actor (such a the pawn). Call SetOwner, PreReplication and RemoveallCues in the appropriate places.

  This is the base class for any Rig unit editor features.
  This class can be derived to your RigUnit if you want editor functionality for your rig unit in the editor module
  You'll have to register the proper class for your RigUnit in your start up module.
  This class exists in ControlRig as ControlRig needs reference to it right now
  @todo: we might be able to move this back to editor module if we create custom BP node that can create property class
  without declaring the type of the class. Right now ControlRig has to know about URigUnitEditor_Base to create/cache

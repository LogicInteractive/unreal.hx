/**
  Base class for games to implement test controllers that use the Gauntlet native
  framework. This is a very thin class that is created automatically based on
  command line params (-gauntlet=MyControllerName) and provides easily overridden
  functions that represent state changes and ticking
  
  In essence your derived class should implement logic that starts and monitors
  a test, then calls EndTest(Result) when the desired criteria are met (or not!)

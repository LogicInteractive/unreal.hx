/**
  Describes one link in a full property path
  For array properties, a link might be the outer (e.g. AttachChildren, -1, None)
  while also it may be an inner (e.g. AttachChildren, 2, Cube)
  Doing this allows us to resolve components regardless of their order, which
  is important for handling component reordering and transient components (e.g.
  runtime billboard components, etc)

????-??-??: 1.0.0
  New Features:

  added UE 4.19 support
  added UE 4.21 support
  added UE 4.22 support
  added Haxe 4 support

    New Features:

    `isValid` speedup
    added dynamic property support for TWeakObjectPtr
    taken off all Engine.h includes, making Unreal.hx strictly IWYU
    added `@:ualign` to allow custom alignment setting for an Unreal.hx-generated struct
    allow `OnRep_` functions to work just as `onRep_`
    stacks are now registered and unregistered as needed, allowing foreign threads to call Haxe functions
    haxe4 new function syntax support for parameter names (deprecating `@:uParamName`)
    many compilation performance improvements
    new live reload mode with a vscode plugin can achieve very fast incremental compilation speed
    multi-thread support - allowing Haxe code to be called from multiple external threads
    added support to LOCTEXT/NSLOCTEXT generation through the unreal.I18n class

    Bugfixes:

    fixed a crash if trying to access unaligned pointers
    fixed a crash if a dynamic wrapper is being finalized when its originated uproperty was gc'd
    fixed FVector_NetQuantize access
    fixed TEnumAsByte TWeakObjectPtr and TSubclassOf issues when they are used as type parameters
    fixed DCE collecting unused Haxe-generated delegates
    fixed multiple compilation detection issues
    fixed `Ref<UObject>` / `Ref<PPtr<FStruct>>`
    reworked the template system to not use @:generic anymore, which stabilizes the dependency chain - so any change doesn't trigger a full haxe build
    `compilationServer` now uses two sequential ports - the first for the hxcpp build, and the second for cppia


  Deprecation:

  all pre-4.19 unreal version support have been dropped

2018-03-26: 0.4.0

  added a way to set configuration options as Haxe code with UhxConfig.hx and UhxConfigLocal.hx
  added dependency checks so we only build each phase if we really need to

  added a way to perform a full C++ build when it is needed, even if no static file has changed
  added a way to detect when a full C++ rebuild is needed
  added glue code unity builds so that we build less C++ files that should not really change
